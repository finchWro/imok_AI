  Objective:
  Verify REQ005 by using the application-generated Message Log to compare observed send behavior with the recorded send results.

  Preconditions:
  - Remote Client Application is connected to the IoT device and cellular network.
  - Communicator Application is connected and ready to receive messages.

  Test Steps:
  1. Enter a unique test message in the Remote Client Application input box (e.g., "HLT005-SEND-001").
  2. Click Send.
  3. Open the application-generated Message Log and locate the most recent sent entry marked with "[SEND]" for comparison.

  Expected Results:
  - The application-generated Message Log contains a "[SEND]" entry with the exact test payload and a timestamp for comparison.
  - The log entry indicates the message was sent, demonstrating REQ005 is fulfilled.
  - Pass/Fail: The test passes when the observed send behavior matches the application-generated Message Log entry; otherwise it fails.

  Actual Log (record during test execution):
  - [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS] [SEND] <paste exact log line from the Message Log>
