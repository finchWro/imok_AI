	HLT007 - Communicator Receive Message Logged
level: 1.6
links:
- REQ010: null
normative: true

	Objective:
	Verify REQ010 by using the Communicator Application Message Log to compare observed receive behavior with recorded receive results.

	Preconditions:
	- Communicator Application is connected and ready to receive messages.
	- Remote Client Application is connected and able to send a message to the Communicator Application.

	Test Steps:
	1. Send a unique test message from the Remote Client Application to the Communicator Application (e.g., "HLT010-RECV-001").
	2. Open the Communicator Application Message Log and locate the most recent received entry marked with "[RECV]" for comparison.

	Expected Results:
	- The Communicator Application Message Log contains a "[RECV]" entry with the exact test payload and a timestamp for comparison.
	- The log entry indicates the message was received, demonstrating REQ010 is fulfilled.
	- Pass/Fail: The test passes when the observed receive behavior matches the Message Log entry; otherwise it fails.

	Actual Log (record during test execution):
	- [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS] [RECV] <paste exact log line from the Message Log>
