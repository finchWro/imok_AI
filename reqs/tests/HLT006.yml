	Objective:
	Verify REQ009 by using the application-generated Message Log to compare observed send behavior with the recorded send results.

	Preconditions:
	- Communicator Application is connected and ready to send messages.
	- Remote Client Application is connected and ready to receive messages.

	Test Steps:
	1. Enter a unique test message in the Communicator Application input box (e.g., "HLT009-SEND-001").
	2. Click Send.
	3. Open the application-generated Message Log and locate the most recent sent entry marked with "[SEND]" for comparison.

	Expected Results:
	- The application-generated Message Log contains a "[SEND]" entry with the exact test payload and a timestamp for comparison.
	- The log entry indicates the message was sent, demonstrating REQ009 is fulfilled.
	- Pass/Fail: The test passes when the observed send behavior matches the application-generated Message Log entry; otherwise it fails.

	Actual Log (record during test execution):
	- [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS] [SEND] <paste exact log line from the Message Log>
