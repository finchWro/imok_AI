  Objective:
  Verify REQ007 by using the application-generated Message Log to compare observed send and receive events with recorded log entries and timestamps.

  Preconditions:
  - Remote Client Application is connected to the IoT device and cellular network.
  - Communicator Application is connected and able to send/receive messages.

  Test Steps:
  1. Send a unique test message from the Remote Client Application (e.g., "HLT007-SEND-001").
  2. Send a unique test message from the Communicator Application to the Remote Client Application (e.g., "HLT007-RECV-001").
  3. Open the application-generated Message Log and locate the most recent "[SEND]" and "[RECV]" entries for comparison.

  Expected Results:
  - The Message Log contains a "[SEND]" entry with the exact send payload and a timestamp.
  - The Message Log contains a "[RECV]" entry with the exact receive payload and a timestamp.
  - Pass/Fail: The test passes when both observed events match the corresponding Message Log entries; otherwise it fails.

  Actual Log (record during test execution):
  - [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS] [SEND] <paste exact log line from the Message Log>
  - [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS] [RECV] <paste exact log line from the Message Log>
