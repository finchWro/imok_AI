  Objective:
  Verify REQ006 by using the application-generated Message Log to compare observed behavior with the recorded receive results.

  Preconditions:
  - Remote Client Application is connected to the IoT device and cellular network.
  - Communicator Application is connected and able to send a message to the Remote Client Application.

  Test Steps:
  1. Send a unique test message from the Communicator Application to the Remote Client Application (e.g., "HLT006-RECV-001").
  2. Open the application-generated Message Log and locate the most recent received entry marked with "[RECV]" for comparison.

  Expected Results:
  - The application-generated Message Log contains a "[RECV]" entry with the exact test payload and a timestamp for comparison.
  - The log entry indicates the message was received (not sent), demonstrating REQ006 is fulfilled.
  - Pass/Fail: The test passes when the observed receive behavior matches the application-generated Message Log entry; otherwise it fails.

  Actual Log (record during test execution):
  - [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS] [RECV] <paste exact log line from the Message Log>
