  The Remote Client Application shall implement the functionality to open a UDP socket connection to Soracom Harvest Data as follows:

  - The application shall parse the response from the IoT device to confirm that the UDP socket has been successfully opened.
  - If the socket is opened successfully, the application shall log the success status.
