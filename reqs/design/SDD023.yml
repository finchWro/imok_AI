  The Client Application shall provide functionality to list all SIMSs associated with the authenticated user account. This feature enables users to view and manage their SIM inventory effectively.

  The following steps outline the process for listing SIMSs:

  1) Client Application shall send a request to the Soracom API to retrieve the list of SIMSs associated with the authenticated user account.
  2) Soracom API shall process the request and return a response containing the details of all SIMSs, including simid, IMSI and session status (true:online/false:offline).
  3) Client Application shall parse the response and display the list of SIMSs in the GUI, allowing users to view their SIM inventory.
  4) Client Application shall display only simid (simid), IMSI(sessionStatus->imsi), and session online status (online/offline) (sessionStatus->online) information for each SIM in the list.
  5) Client Application shall store the retrieved SIM information locally for further operations, such as selecting a SIM for data transmission.
