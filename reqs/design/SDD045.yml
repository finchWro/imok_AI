  The Remote Client Application shall monitor RSRP (Reference Signal Received Power) using AT%MEAS="8" command to subscribe to notifications of changes in signal quality.

  Notification format is: %%MEAS:Signal Quality:RSRP= <RSRP>,RSRQ= <RSRQ>,SINR= <SINR>,RSSI= <RSSI> where:

  <RSRP>
    Integer. Reported RSRP value in dBm.
    Valid range: -140 to -44 dBm
    255 - Not known or not detectable

  <RSRQ>
    Integer. Reported RSRQ value in dB.
    Valid range: -20 to -3 dB
    255 - Not known or not detectable

  <SINR>
    Integer. Reported SINR value in dB.
    Valid range: -20 to 30 dB
    255 - Not known or not detectable

  <RSSI>
    Integer. Reported RSSI value in dBm.
    Valid range: -120 to -40 dBm
    255 - Not known or not detectable

  RSRP shall be displayed on the Remote Client Application GUI for user awareness.
