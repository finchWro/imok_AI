  The Remote Client Application shall monitor RSRP (Reference Signal Received Power) using AT%CESQ=1 command to subscribe to notifications of changes in signal quality.

  Notification format is: %CESQ: <rsrp>,<rsrq>,<snr>,<rscp> where:

  <rsrp>
    Integer. Reported RSRP value.
    0 - When measured RSRP < -140 dBm
    1 - When -140 dBm ≤ measured RSRP < -139 dBm
    2 - When -139 dBm ≤ measured RSRP < -138 dBm
    ...
    95 - When -46 dBm ≤ measured RSRP < -45 dBm
    96 - When -45 dBm ≤ measured RSRP < -44 dBm
    97 - When -44 dBm ≤ measured RSRP
    255 - Not known or not detectable
    The lower dB boundary of this range can be determined using the reported RSRP value and the following formula: reported RSRP value-141=dBm. For example, 95-141=-46 dBm. Thus, the range is -46 dBm ≤ measured RSRP < -45 dBm.

  RSRP shall be displayed on the Remote Client Application GUI for user awareness.
