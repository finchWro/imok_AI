  The Remote Client Application shall implement the functionality to open a UDP socket connection to Soracom Harvest Data as follows:


  - Enable socket events with command AT%SOCKETEV=0,1
  - Create UDP socket with command AT%SOCKETCMD="ALLOCATE",1,"UDP","OPEN","harvest.soracom.io",8514
  - Activate the socket with command AT%SOCKETCMD="ACTIVATE",1
  - The application shall parse the response from the IoT device to confirm that the UDP socket has been successfully opened (OK response).
  - If the socket is opened successfully, the application shall log the success status.
