  The Remote Client Application shall follow ITU-T Recommendation V.250 for the implementation and usage of AT commands to communicate with the cellular modem. This includes:

  - The Receive Client Application shall AT command and wait for appropriate responses from the modem to ensure successful execution of commands.
  - The application shall implement error handling mechanisms to manage unexpected responses or failures in command execution.
  - The application shall log AT command interactions for debugging and diagnostic purposes.
  - The application shall implement timeouts for AT command responses to prevent indefinite waiting periods.

  Above mentioned requirements are applicable to all AT commands used in other design specifications.
