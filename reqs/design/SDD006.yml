  The Remote Client Application shall implement the connection status indicator as follows:


  - A green circle icon indicates that the application is connected to the IoT device.
  - A red circle icon indicates that the application is disconnected from the IoT device.
  - A yellow circle icon indicates that the application is attempting to connect to the IoT device.

  The connection status indicator shall be prominently displayed in the main window of the Remote Client Application, ensuring that users can easily monitor the connection status at all times.
